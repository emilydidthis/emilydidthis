***Racing Thoughts* is an interactive experience intended to spark self-reflection. It calculates the speed at which people come up negative and positive thoughts and presents the data back to the user in the form of a receipt – a physical takeaway, if you will.**

The project was derived from my own struggle to compliment myself. At the time of development, when asked by my therapist to recite self-affirmations, I couldn’t think of a single positive thing to say. With self-deprecations or insults, however, the stream was fast-flowing and easy. I performed what would essentially be the Racing Thoughts experience on some friends and was surprised to find that many also found it difficult to say nice things about themselves.

While it would have been nice to develop an experience that encouraged people to only speak kindly of themselves, I found that taking the most neutral approach, using data, to be the most successful. It’s difficult to change people, but I could provide something to reflect on: *Does a positive or negative thought come faster for me? What does the outcome reveal about how I think of myself?*
