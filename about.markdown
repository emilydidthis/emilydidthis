Hi! I'm Emily, a multimedia storyteller and educator based in NYC. In my own work, I am interested in utilizating technology and computation to create experiences of self-reflection, because I believe by better understanding ourselves, we can increase our empathy for others.

Currently, I am adjunct professor at NYU, teaching classes in both the Tisch School of the Arts and the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. 

Before that, I was a course instructor at Girls Who Code and a video producer at Scholastic, where I made educational videos for kids. 

If you're looking for a laugh, you can check out the daily [cartoons](https://www.instagram.com/everydaysajoke/) I made for 100 days straight.
